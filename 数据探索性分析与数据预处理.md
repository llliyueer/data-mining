用R语言对2个数据集进行探索性分析与预处理,由于数据量庞大，现选取其中个别数据量进行分析和处理。选取数据属性如下：

-----

## 数据集1：NFL Play-by-Play 2009-2017

### 属性的选择：

"Drive" - Drive number

"sp" - Whether the play resulted in a score (any kind of score)

"qtr" - Quarter of Game

"down" - Down of the given play

"time" - Time at start of play

"yrdln" - Between 0 and 50

"ydstogo" - Yards to go for a first down

"ydsnet" - Total yards gained on a given drive

"posteam" - The team on offense

"AirYards" - Number of yards the ball was thrown in the air for both complete and incomplete pass attempts (negative means behind line of scrimmage)

"YardsAfterCatch" - Number of yards receiver gained after catch

"QBHit" - Binary: 1 if the QB was knocked to the ground else 0


"desc" - A detailed description of what occured during the play

### 结论：
如上述结果所示，直方图能够很直观的反应属性的分布情况，盒图也能将离群值很好地进行识别。直观地从qq图上来看，数据集1的yrdln属性并非来自正态分布的数据，数据集2的Numbers Of Existing Stories属性可能服从正太分布。

### 数据1、2的缺失处理：

将缺失部分剔除，对数据本身无影响，数据分析结果于剔除前一致；
除此之外，分别采取用均值和中位数填补缺失值，数据分析结果如下所示：

### 总结

填补缺失值前后的新旧数据集的可视化对比，可见无论是中位数填补还是均值填补，对最值和四分之一位数没有影响，四分之三位数有相应的改变，根据你填补数据的不同，均值和中位数其中一个会有所改变。
